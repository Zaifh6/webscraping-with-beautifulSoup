## About The Project

This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python with the `BeautifulSoup` library for parsing HTML, `Requests` for making HTTP requests, and `Pandas` for data manipulation and storage. The objective is to extract data from web pages and convert it into a structured format suitable for analysis.

### Features

- **Data Extraction**: Scrape data from websites and parse HTML content with `BeautifulSoup`.
